Restaurant kitchen display system with trello-board drag-and-drop live ticketing system that allows multiple users to simulataneously collaborate completing orders.

A simple application for small restaurants who are looking to streamline the process between front staff service and kitchen team. Application listens to incoming orders received by a server's standardized API and displays them as Order task cards for the kitchen staff. Multiple users can use the app simultaneously to collaborate on completing the customer orders. Kitcher users can drag and drop an order through the a progress board and front staff can view the progress of orders. Users are notified whenever someone starts or moves an order to the next stage.

Utilizes React, Express, Node.js, and modified React DnD to achieve display capabilities.
